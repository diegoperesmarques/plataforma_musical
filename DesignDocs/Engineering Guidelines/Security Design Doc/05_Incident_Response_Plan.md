# Security Design Doc: Incident Response Plan

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines a foundational plan for responding to security incidents. An incident is any event that compromises the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the "Plataforma Musical" application or its data.

The goal of this plan is to ensure a swift, effective, and orderly response to minimize damage, recover quickly, and learn from the event.

## 2. Roles and Responsibilities

*   **Incident Commander**: The person responsible for leading the incident response effort. This is typically the tech lead or a senior engineer.
*   **Technical Lead**: The person responsible for the technical aspects of the response, such as analyzing logs, patching vulnerabilities, and restoring service.
*   **Communications Lead**: The person responsible for communicating with stakeholders, including users if necessary.

*For a small team, these roles may be filled by the same person.*

## 3. Incident Response Phases

We will follow the PICERL model for incident response: Preparation, Identification, Containment, Eradication, Recovery, and Lessons Learned.

### 3.1. Preparation

*This is the ongoing phase before an incident occurs.*

*   **Tools**: Ensure logging, monitoring, and alerting are in place.
*   **Documentation**: Keep this plan and other technical documentation up-to-date.
*   **Access Control**: Ensure that access to production systems is limited to authorized personnel.

### 3.2. Identification

*How do we know an incident has occurred?*

*   **Triggers**: An incident might be identified through:
    *   Alerts from monitoring systems (e.g., unusual CPU usage, high error rates).
    *   A user report (e.g., "I'm seeing strange content on the lesson page").
    *   A notification from a third party (e.g., GitHub reporting a vulnerability in a dependency).
*   **Action**: Once a potential incident is identified, the Incident Commander should be notified immediately. The first step is to confirm that it is a real incident and assess its initial impact.

### 3.3. Containment

*Limit the damage.*

*   **Goal**: Isolate the affected system to prevent the incident from spreading.
*   **Actions**:
    *   **Short-Term**: This could involve temporarily taking the application offline, blocking a malicious IP address, or disabling a compromised feature.
    *   **Long-Term**: Create a clean, isolated environment for forensic analysis if needed. Do not tamper with the compromised system.

### 3.4. Eradication

*Find and eliminate the root cause.*

*   **Goal**: Remove the threat from the environment.
*   **Actions**:
    *   **Identify the Vulnerability**: Analyze logs and system state to understand how the attacker gained access or caused the issue. Was it a vulnerable dependency? A code flaw?
    *   **Patch the Vulnerability**: Deploy the fix. For example, if the root cause was an XSS vulnerability, deploy the code that properly sanitizes the input.

### 3.5. Recovery

*Restore service to a secure state.*

*   **Goal**: Safely bring the application back online.
*   **Actions**:
    *   **Restore from Backup**: If data was corrupted, restore it from a known-good backup.
    *   **Verify Security**: Before going live, double-check that the vulnerability has been patched and that there are no other signs of compromise.
    *   **Monitor Closely**: After restoring service, monitor the application and infrastructure closely for any unusual activity.

### 3.6. Lessons Learned (Post-Mortem)

*Prevent it from happening again.*

*   **Goal**: Within one week of resolving the incident, conduct a blameless post-mortem.
*   **Process**: The Incident Commander will lead a meeting to discuss:
    *   What happened?
    *   What was the impact?
    *   What went well during the response?
    *   What could have gone better?
    *   What actions can we take to prevent this class of incident in the future?
*   **Output**: A brief report summarizing the incident and a list of actionable follow-up tasks to improve security.
