# Security Design Doc: Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL)

## 1. Introduction

To build a secure application, security must be integrated into every phase of the development lifecycle, from design to deployment and maintenance. This document outlines the Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL) practices for the "Plataforma Musical" project.

## 2. Key Practices

### 2.1. Secure Coding Training

*   **Requirement**: All developers working on the project should be familiar with common web security vulnerabilities (e.g., OWASP Top 10) and secure coding best practices for React/JavaScript.
*   **Action**: Review the guidelines in `03_Frontend_Security_Guidelines.md` and `04_Future_Backend_Security_Requirements.md`.

### 2.2. Security in Design

*   **Requirement**: Security must be a primary consideration during the design phase of any new feature.
*   **Action**: For any significant new feature (e.g., adding user comments, payment processing), the threat model in `01_Threat_Model.md` must be updated. The feature should be designed with security principles like "least privilege" and "defense in depth" in mind.

### 2.3. Dependency Management

*   **Vulnerability**: Third-party libraries can contain security vulnerabilities. The project currently uses `marked`, which has had vulnerabilities in the past.
*   **Action**:
    *   **Regular Scanning**: Use `npm audit` or a similar tool (like GitHub's Dependabot) to regularly scan for known vulnerabilities in project dependencies. This should be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.
    *   **Update Policy**: Keep dependencies up-to-date. When a critical or high-severity vulnerability is found, it must be patched or mitigated within an agreed-upon timeframe (e.g., 2 weeks).
    *   **Minimalism**: Only add dependencies that are strictly necessary.

### 2.4. Static Application Security Testing (SAST)

*   **Vulnerability**: Code written for the application can contain security flaws.
*   **Action**:
    *   **Linting for Security**: Configure ESLint with a security-focused plugin (e.g., `eslint-plugin-security`) to automatically catch common security issues in JavaScript code during development.
    *   **CI/CD Integration**: Integrate SAST tools into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically scan every pull request for potential security vulnerabilities before it is merged.

### 2.5. Secure Code Review

*   **Requirement**: All code changes must be reviewed by at least one other developer before being merged into the main branch.
*   **Action**: Code reviews must explicitly include a security check. Reviewers should ask:
    *   Does this change introduce any new security risks?
    *   Does it handle all input as untrusted?
    *   Is output properly encoded to prevent XSS?
    *   If it involves a new dependency, has that dependency been vetted?

### 2.6. Content Security Policy (CSP)

*   **Requirement**: A strict Content Security Policy is one of the most effective ways to prevent XSS.
*   **Action**: Implement a CSP that restricts the sources of scripts, styles, and other content. For a React app, this requires careful configuration but is highly recommended. A starting point for the policy would be:
    ```
    Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data:;
    ```
    *Note: `unsafe-inline` for styles may be required for some libraries but should be avoided if possible.*

## 3. Deployment and Maintenance

*   **HTTPS**: The application must be served exclusively over HTTPS.
*   **Security Headers**: In addition to CSP, other security headers like `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `Strict-Transport-Security`, and `X-Frame-Options` should be configured on the webserver.
*   **Monitoring**: The application and infrastructure should be monitored for security events and anomalies.
