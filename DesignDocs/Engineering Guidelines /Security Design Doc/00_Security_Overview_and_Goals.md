# Security Design Doc: Overview and Goals

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the security posture, principles, and goals for the "Plataforma Musical" application. Its purpose is to provide a centralized reference for all security-related considerations during the design, development, and deployment phases.

The application is currently a client-side single-page application (SPA) built with React. It serves educational content (lessons and exercises) to users. Future plans may include user accounts, progress tracking, and interactive features, which will introduce new security challenges.

## 2. Security Goals

The primary security goals for this project are:

*   **Protect Users**: Ensure that users of the application are safe from attacks such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), data theft, and other common web vulnerabilities.
*   **Protect Application Integrity**: Maintain the integrity of the application and its content, ensuring that what users see is what is intended.
*   **Ensure Availability**: Prevent Denial of Service (DoS) attacks that could disrupt the user's access to the educational platform.
*   **Establish a Secure Foundation**: Implement security as a foundational, proactive practice ("shift-left") rather than a reactive one. This document and its related files are the first step.

## 3. Scope

This security design documentation covers:

*   The current React-based frontend application.
*   The processing and rendering of external content (e.g., Markdown files).
*   Guidelines and requirements for future development, including a potential backend API, user authentication, and data storage.

## 4. Core Security Principles

*   **Defense in Depth**: Security will be implemented in layers, so that if one control fails, others are in place to mitigate the threat.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege**: Components and future users will only be granted the minimum permissions necessary to perform their functions.
*   **Secure by Default**: The application will be configured to be secure by default. Any deviations that reduce security must be explicitly justified and approved.
*   **Input Validation and Output Encoding**: All input will be treated as untrusted and validated. All output will be properly encoded to prevent injection attacks.
